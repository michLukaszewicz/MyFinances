# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**MyFinances** — a personal-finance MVP (single user) for importing bank CSV statements (mBank, then Revolut, then Erste Bank Polska), manually categorizing transactions, detecting duplicates and internal transfers, and visualizing spend-per-category against both historical averages and optional per-category budgets. Full requirements live in [context/foundation/prd.md](context/foundation/prd.md). Solo build, after-hours, 3-week MVP timeline, no multi-tenant/sharing.

Foundation (F-01) and slices S-01/S-02/S-03/S-04/S-09/S-10 are implemented and merged to `main` — auth (register/login/persistent session), mBank CSV import with dedup, manual transaction entry, the categorization queue (with internal-transfer auto-flagging), the dashboard transaction history view, the spend/income donut charts (current month, click-to-filter), and user-managed bank accounts. See [context/foundation/roadmap.md](context/foundation/roadmap.md) for current per-slice status; not-yet-built slices (S-05 budget-vs-actual, S-06 average-deviation signal, S-07 Revolut import, S-08 Erste import) remain `proposed`.

## Architecture

Split stack under `MyFinances/`, single-origin in production:

- **`MyFinances/backend`** — ASP.NET Core (net10.0) minimal-API project (`MyFinances.Api.csproj`). All endpoints are mounted under `/api` via `app.MapGroup("/api")` in [Program.cs](MyFinances/backend/Program.cs). In production the API also serves the built frontend as static files (`UseStaticFiles` + `MapFallbackToFile("index.html")`), so the browser only ever talks to one origin and no CORS is needed there.
- **`MyFinances/frontend`** — React Router v8 SPA (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind v4). API calls go through [app/lib/api.ts](MyFinances/frontend/app/lib/api.ts)'s `apiFetch`, which targets `VITE_API_BASE_URL` or defaults to `/api`.
- **Dev-time wiring**: the frontend's Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:5007` (see [vite.config.ts](MyFinances/frontend/vite.config.ts)); the backend's `FrontendDev` CORS policy allows `http://localhost:5173` for the case where the frontend is hit directly instead of through the proxy.
- **Production build wiring**: `MyFinances.Api.csproj`'s `BuildAndCopyFrontend` target runs `npm ci && npm run build` in the frontend and copies `build/client/**` into the publish output's `wwwroot`, *after* the `Publish` target (not before — see the comment in the csproj for why). `dotnet build`/`dotnet run` never touch the frontend; local dev always uses the separate Vite server + proxy.

## Commands

Backend (from `MyFinances/backend`):
```bash
dotnet run                # http://localhost:5007, Swagger UI at /swagger
dotnet build
dotnet publish            # also builds+copies the frontend into wwwroot (see above)
```

Frontend (from `MyFinances/frontend`):
```bash
npm run dev          # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to the backend
npm run build        # production build -> build/client + build/server
npm run typecheck    # react-router typegen && tsc
```

Backend has an xUnit test suite (`MyFinances/backend/Tests`, run via `dotnet test` from `MyFinances/backend`). No frontend test framework exists yet.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit context

This repo was scaffolded using the `/10x-*` skill chain (`10x-init` → `10x-shape` → `10x-prd` → `10x-tech-stack-selector` → `10x-bootstrapper`). Key hand-off artifacts:

- [context/foundation/prd.md](context/foundation/prd.md) — the locked PRD (source of truth for scope/requirements).
- [context/foundation/tech-stack.md](context/foundation/tech-stack.md) — backend hand-off (`starter_id: dotnet`).
- [context/foundation/tech-stack-frontend.md](context/foundation/tech-stack-frontend.md) — companion frontend hand-off (`starter_id: react-router`); this split exists because the bootstrapper schema carries one `starter_id` per file, and the project requested a polyglot .NET + React stack.
- [context/changes/bootstrap-verification/verification.md](context/changes/bootstrap-verification/verification.md) — audit trail from the scaffold run.
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls, consumed by later planning/review skills.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/` — it's immutable; a change targeting it should be redirected to `/10x-new`.

For how any `/10x-*` skill works mechanically (task routing, conflict policy, verification-log schema, etc.), see that skill's own definition under `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Internal research (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-research <change-id>` | You need evidence from the existing codebase — patterns, conventions, integration points, or existing implementations. Runs parallel sub-agents over the repo and writes structured findings to `research.md`. |
| **External research (lesson focus)** | |
| exa.ai | You need AI-native web search for library comparisons, best practices, or ecosystem context that the codebase cannot answer. |
| Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`) | You need live, current documentation for a specific library or framework. Resolves a library ID first, then fetches relevant doc pages. |
| **Framing spare wheel** | |
| `/10x-frame <change-id>` | The plan won't converge, the plan doesn't deliver expected results, or persistent drift keeps breaking the implementation. Use as an escape hatch on a separate problem (demonstrated on Space Explorers example), not as pre-research ritual. |
| **Planning and execution** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` / `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | Use the same planning and execution chain from Lesson 2, now with upstream research evidence feeding the plan. |

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:
1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
